### Description

Hello! I'm a beginner in backend application development, and this project is part of a Coursera course 
assignment aimed at helping me earn a certification. The goal of this project is to create a server using **Node.js** 
and **Express.js** that manages a book library, where users can retrieve book information, add, update, and delete 
reviews, and perform searches based on various criteria. This application also includes user authentication 
through JWT and session handling.

### ðŸ“‹ Project Features

This application offers the following features to registered users:

1. **Retrieve a List of Available Books**: Display all available books in the library.
2. **Search for Books by Author, Title, or ISBN**.
3. **Add Reviews for Books**: Registered users can add their own reviews to books.
4. **Modify and Delete Reviews**: Registered users can update or delete their reviews.
5. **User Authentication and Sessions**: Secured routes using JWT to manage user access.

### ðŸ’» Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework used for creating RESTful APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for authentication to ensure secure user access.
- **Postman**: For testing API routes during development.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- To enhance understanding of backend development with Node.js and Express.js.
- To implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing books and reviews.
- To set up user authentication using JWT and session-based access control.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Git installed for repository cloning.
- Postman for API testing (optional but recommended).


### ðŸ“‘ Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by a Coursera course on backend development, where it serves as a practical assignment 
for learners to apply the concepts of API development, user authentication, and session management.
